# APCSWork


This is all the AP CSP / CSA work I did for high school. It is sectioned into CSP and CSA 24-25 
It will contain FRQs, Games, Work, and testers

My code is like the ramblings of a mad man. Calling methods everywhere, doing the stupidest things. Everything

Its split into branches yet the main will have folders for the work for easier browsing
